ME562 - Constitutive Modeling Course Notes (Feb.
 17, 2015)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Experimental Loading Paths and Additional Stress Parameters
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Buck is basing the premise of this course on the principle that we are analyzing
 a material with somewhat unique properties that are not represented in
 an existing constitutive equation.
 For example, no satisfactory constitutive equations exist in Sierra, Abaqus,
 etc.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
How to determine if a constitutive equation is suitable?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You must compare experimental data to the results predicted from the constitutiv
e model.
 How many different stress paths are needed to validate a particular constitutiv
e equation...
 an infinite amount.
 However, we typically only have one or two if we are lucky! You must check
 the constitutive equation against data to validate that it is of use.
 If an existing version of a constitutive equation is not satisfactory,
 you must develop your own version and then validate it! This assumes your
 constitutive equation represents certain features that are not currently
 represented by existing models.
 For example, if you only have access to an isotropic model but experimental
 results show that the material of interest is anisotropic, then you may
 need to develop a new constitutive equation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With these ideas in mind, we must be aware of how experimental data is obtained,
 and that is why we are reviewing stress paths.

 codes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Typically the constitutive equation subroutine is called with strain increments,
 from which stress increments are computed.
 For complicated constitutive equations, the calculation of stress increments
 is very computationally expensive.
 Once the stress increments are computed, the stresses are updated with
 this increments.
 On the contrary, experimental data often has prescribed stress increments,
 not strain; therefore, we must adjust our calculations to accommodate this
 fact.
 Also, a stress or strain increment does not necessarily imply transient
 behavior (i.e.
 varying with time).
 Even in a static analysis, stresses will be modeled as increasing monotonically
 over a defined number of increments and with each stress increment is an
 associated strain increment...
 nothing happens instantaneously.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Underlying assumptions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Almost all constitutive equations implicitly assume that stress and strain
 are homogenous (e.g., values do not vary throughout the material).
 This assumption means that stress components and all strain components
 are the same! This assumption is violated typically near the limit point,
 which is the maximum stress that a material can maintain, and this assumption
 is definitely violated when a material begins to soften (e.g., stress decreases
 and the strain rate increases).
 The homogeneity assumption is violated near the limit point because localizatio
n of stresses and strains occurs e.g., necking, bulging, or shear banding.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Experimentalists can get around violated this assumption by measuring displaceme
nts.
 This way, strains may be defined in such a way that averaged over the entire
 body e.g., by calculating strains via LVDTs at the end of the specimen rather
 than using strain rosettes over small regions.
 If LVDTs are used, then the experimentalists reports AVERAGE strains (displacem
ent over the length)! Another alternative would be to present displacement
 (not strain) versus force (no stress).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Common experimental paths and features of experimental data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Uniaxial stress in tension (see hand notes page 11-2)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Commonly applied to metals (cohesive materials), that have strength derived
 from metallic bonds (i.e., an electron cloud) that have isotropic strength
 (i.e., not directional dependent).
 For this test, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{11}\ne0$
\end_inset

 (where the 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{11}$
\end_inset

 is in the axial direction) and all other stress components are zero.
 Additionally, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{11}$
\end_inset

 is assumed to be homogenous (uniform) across the center of the specimen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note, the calculation of stress in the region of a loading or confining
 device (grips on end caps) is nearly impossible without the use if the
 FEM.
 But that's okay, because are are not concerned with the ends of specimen
 but rather the middle where stresses and strains are assumed uniform.
 Because the surface traction in the region of concern is zero (a boundary
 condition), 
\begin_inset Formula $\textbf{{\bf \tau}=\underbar{0}}$
\end_inset

 , then 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{22}=\sigma_{33}=\sigma_{12}=\sigma_{13}=\sigma_{23}=0$
\end_inset

 at the surface of the material (note, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{23}=0$
\end_inset

 argument is made based on symmetry of the horizontal plane).
 The argument is then that because the cross-sectional region of concern
 is so small, the internal stresses will not have sufficient area to grow.
 Therefore, we want the diameter of width of the specimen to be small over
 a large length ( 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{D}{L}<<1$
\end_inset

) .
 If the diameter is not small, stresses not aligned with 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{11}$
\end_inset

may develop and violate assumptions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Uniaxial stress in compression
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Typically a length to diameter ration >> 2 is used.
 Effort should be made to minimize end effects, i.e., minimize the friction
 between loading platens and specimen.
 Shear tractions are inevitable

\begin_layout Standard
Enhanced Ductility: occurs when the deformation becomes more ductile (i.e.
 greater plastic deformation).
 This occurs in geologic materials when the mean pressure is increased.
 This implies that the amount of strain energy stored up to the limit point
 in greater with greater mean pressures.
