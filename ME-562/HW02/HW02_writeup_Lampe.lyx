Overview of assignment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Write a program that provides the matrix of elasticity coefficients with
 respect to a given basis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The function 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Elastic()
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 was written to calculate the coefficients of the stiffness matrix for a
 material having at least orthotropic symmetry (i.e., nine independent elastic
 parameters).
 If a material has greater symmetry (e.g., transverse isotropy (five in independen
t parameters), cubic symmetry (3 independent parameters), complete isotropy
 (2 independent parameters), etc), the input parameters into Elastic() must
 be modified accordingly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Restrictions have been made on the input values to maintain a nonsingular
 (invertible) flexibility matrix, those restrictions include:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Poisson's ratios (
\begin_inset Formula $\nu\mbox{) have been constrained to values greater than -1.0 and less than 0.5 \ensuremath{\Rightarrow-1.0<\nu<0.5}}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Young's Moduli (
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

) have been constrained to positive values greater than zero 
\begin_inset Formula $\Rightarrow Y>0$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Shear Moduli (
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

) have been constrained to positive values greater than zero 
\begin_inset Formula $\Rightarrow$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $G>0$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As verification of the Elastic() routine, parameters for a completely isotropic
 material were used as input and the output was checked against hand calculation
s.
 Only three matrix components were needed to verify the isotropic parameters
 because for such a material 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{11}=E_{22}=E_{33}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{12}=E_{23}=E_{31}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{44}=E_{55}=E_{66}$
\end_inset

 and the matrix is symmetric, all remaining components take values of zero.
 Only two isotropic parameters are independent (
\begin_inset Formula $E_{11}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{12}$
\end_inset

), while the third (
\begin_inset Formula $E_{44}$
\end_inset

) parameter is dependent upon the previous two.
 Results from this verification are shown below and the numerical output
 from Elastic() is shown in the attached code under Problem 1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E_{11}=\frac{{Y(1-\nu)}}{(1+\nu)(1-2\nu)}=12
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E_{12}=E_{11}\frac{\nu}{(1-\nu)}=\frac{Y\nu}{(1+\nu)(1-2\nu)}=4
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E_{44}=2G=E_{11}-E_{12}=\frac{Y}{(1+\nu)}=16
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Orthotropic Material
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Material planes of symmetry may be defined as planes on which only normal
 stresses are present (i.e., no shear stress).
 Therefore, a plane of symmetry may be viewed as a principal direction of
 the material, this problem was approached with concept at hand.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An elastic-orthotropic material has three orthogonal planes of elastic symmetry.
 If a cube is cut with two orthogonal edges aligned with two planes of symmetry,
 the third edge must also be aligned with a plane of symmetry.
 The linear-elastic constitutive equation for an elastic-orthotropic material
 is shown below in V-M notation, where this representation implies that
 material planes of symmetry are aligned with the chosen basis.
 Regarding the constitutive relationship shown below, 
\begin_inset Formula $\bigl[E^{nn}\bigr]$
\end_inset

 represents a full-symmetric 3x3 matrix and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bigl[E^{ss}\bigr]_{D}$
\end_inset

 represents a diagonal 3x3 matrix and the 
\begin_inset Formula $[E^{ns}]$
\end_inset

 and

 matrices represent 3x3 null matrices (only when the bases are aligned with
 planes of orthotropic symmetry).
 Additionally, 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\sigma^{nn}\}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\sigma^{ss}\}$
\end_inset

 are 3x1 mathematical vectors of the normal and shear components, respectively,
 of the Cauchy stress tensor and 
\begin_inset Formula $\{e^{nn}\}$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $\{e^{ss}\}$
\end_inset

 are their corresponding strain components.
 When the constitutive equation below is not represented in a bases aligned
 with the material planes of symmetry, the constitutive relation 
\begin_inset Formula $[E]_{6x6}$
\end_inset

 will likely be a full rank matrix (e.g., the matrix will likely contain all
 nonzero values because 
\begin_inset Formula $[E^{sn}]$
\end_inset

 = 
\begin_inset Formula $[E^{ns}]^{T}\ne[0]$
\end_inset

 ).
\end_layout

No, the normal components of the strain will not be the same (although the

No, the shear components of strain are nonzero, again this results from

Material of Choice
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I chose rock salt (halite) as my anisotropic material.
 Halite has a cubic crystalline structure; therefore, it has cubic symmetry
 (three independent elastic parameters).
 The following values for engineering moduli were obtained:

I also found published values for the elastic constants directly.
 The author used Lam√©s parameters for the stiffness matrix; therefore, I
 converted these values to be in terms consistent with those used in class
 (i.e., Young's Modulus, Poission's Ratio, and Shear Modulus), both sets of
 values are provided below.

The

goodness
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the isotropic approximation was based on a residual (R) scaled from
 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a very poor approximation and 0 indicates the
 elasticity components are perfectly represented by the isotropic approximation.
 The R value for the isotropic approximation was 0.32.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Elasticity Components in an Alternate Basis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The components of the fourth order stiffness tensor, 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\underline{\underline{\underline{E}}}}$
\end_inset

, were transformed from a basis with axes aligned with the orthotropic planes
 of symmetry
\begin_inset Formula $\Big(\overset{E-E}{[E]}\Big)$
\end_inset

 to a different orthonormal basis with an arbitrary orientation 
\begin_inset Formula $\Big(\overset{e-e}{[E]}\Big)$
\end_inset

 in V-M notation.
 This was accomplished by performing the operation shown below, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\overset{e-E}{[A]}$
\end_inset

 is the transformation matrix for fourth order tensors (represented in V-M
 notation) to represent components in the 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 bases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\overset{e-e}{[E]}=\overset{e-E}{[A]}\overset{E-E}{[E]}\overset{E-e}{[A]}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results of this operation are shown in the attached code under problem
 4, and the stiffness matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\overset{e-e}{[E]}$
\end_inset

 takes the variable 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

E_ee
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the numerical calculations.
 The matrix of components resulting from this transformation contained no
 zero values, where the matrix of components aligned with the orthotropic
 planes of symmetry had upper right and lower left quarters of all zero
 values and the lower right quarter contained only diagonal nonzero components.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An isotropic approximation of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\overset{e-e}{[E]}$
\end_inset

 components was again made.
 This approximation resulted in the same values of engineering moduli 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{iso}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{iso}$
\end_inset

 as were obtained from the 
\begin_inset Formula $\overset{E-E}{[E]}$
\end_inset

 components.
 This is to be expected as both fits were to the same tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\underline{\underline{\underline{E}}}}$
\end_inset

, which is constant regardless of basis.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Find Material Axes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Find Eigenvectors of Elasticity Matrix
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\underline{\underline{\underline{E}}}}$
\end_inset

 were obtained with respect to the 
\begin_inset Formula $e-e-e-e$
\end_inset

 basis, and these values are shown under Problem 5 in the attached code.
 Of the six eigenvalues obtained, only 3 are unique.
 All six eigenvectors appear unique when viewed in V-M notation as a 6x1
 vector and converted to the components of second-order eigentensors.
 The components of these eigentensors provide a transformation relationship
 between the the principal basis of 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\underline{\underline{\underline{E}}}}$
\end_inset

 and the 
\begin_inset Formula $e-e-e-e$
\end_inset

 basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\Big(\overset{P-e}{[A]}\Big)$
\end_inset

.
 Although I am unsure of this reasoning as typically the transformation
 matrices have been orthonormal, but my calculations show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\overset{P-e}{[A]}$
\end_inset

 is not orthonormal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Convert Eigenvectors from V-M Notation to Second Order Eigentensors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each eigenvector of 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{\underline{\underline{\underline{E}}}}$
\end_inset

 , or row of 
\begin_inset Formula $\overset{P-e}{[A]}$
\end_inset

, was converted from a to a second-order eigentensor.
 The components of each of these six second-order eigentensors relate the
 specific eigenvector to the original arbitrarily orientated basis (i.e.,
 the transformation matrices
\begin_inset Formula $\overset{P_{1}-e}{[a]}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\overset{P_{2}-e}{[a]}$
\end_inset

 , etc.).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Determine Eigenvectors for Each of the 6 Second Order Eigentensors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The eigenvectors for each of the six second-order eigentensors were determined,
 where these eigenvectors are defined to be the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

material vectors
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 I believe this implies that each of these material vectors lies within
 a plan of material symmetry.
 These material vectors are associated with the basis as defined by the
 six eigentensors, and the six eigentensors were associated with the arbitrarily
 orientated 
\begin_inset Formula $\textbf{e}$
\end_inset

 basis; therefore, the material vectors are also associated with the 
\begin_inset Formula $\textbf{e}$
\end_inset

 basis.
 Therefore, components of each respective material vector set relate a material
 basis to the arbitrary basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\textbf{e}$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\overset{M-e}{[a]}\Rightarrow\begin{bmatrix}M_{1}^{1}\textbf{e}_{1} & M_{2}^{1}\textbf{e}_{2} & M_{3}^{1}\textbf{e}_{3}\\
M_{1}^{2}\textbf{e}_{1} & M_{2}^{2}\textbf{e}_{2} & M_{3}^{2}\textbf{e}_{3}\\
M_{1}^{3}\textbf{e}_{1} & M_{2}^{3}\textbf{e}_{2} & M_{3}^{3}\textbf{e}_{3}
\end{bmatrix}

Obtain V-M Components of the Elasticity Matrix With Respect to Two Orthonormal
 Material Bases
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Results from this are shown in the attached code.
 Elasticity matrices with respect to material bases 4 and 5 (i.e., those calculate
d from the fourth and fifth eigenvectors of the elasticity matrix) reproduce
 the matrix exactly.
 However, components of the elasticity matrix in the remaining four material
 bases do not reproduce the original components.
 Additionally, the material basis from the first elasticity eigenvector
 is not orthonormal.
