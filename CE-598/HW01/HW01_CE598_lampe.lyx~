\begin_layout Subsection
Show why mass density is undefined on the boudnary of a homogeneous material
 body.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Density is the ratio of an amount of matter having mass 
\begin_inset Formula $(\Delta m)$
\end_inset

 to the volume that matter occupies 
\begin_inset Formula $(\Delta V).$
\end_inset

 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 represent the center of mass (centroid) of the volume 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta V$
\end_inset

.
 When density is defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $lim_{\Delta V\rightarrow0}(\Delta m/\Delta V)$
\end_inset

, this definition is physically limited (in an engineering sense) to a minimium
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta V$
\end_inset

 with a characteristic length that is greater than the mean free path of
 the molecules which compose the homogenous body.
 Therefore, when 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 is chosen on the boundary of a homogenous body 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta V$
\end_inset

 will encompass a volume that is not a part of that homogenous body.
 This will then provide a value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 that is not representative of the homogenous body.
 Therefore, 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 is only meaningful when 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta V$
\end_inset

is of an order greater than that of the mean free path and greater than
 the characteristic length of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta V$
\end_inset

 from the boundary.

\begin_layout Subsection
Describe and sketch three physical situations in which the traction vector
 is undefined at a point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tractions are typically undefined as a result of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta A$
\end_inset

 being undefined, the following lists some situations in which this is so
 and Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Examples-of-undefined"

\end_inset

 illustrates these:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
a) At a corner: the area which the traction is applied is said to be uniquely
 described by the unit normal to that area; however, at an edge a unique
 normal vector does not exist and therefore the traction is not defined.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
b) At a crack front: the force applied by the traction encompasses a very
 small area, which may result in an unrealistically high magnitude of the
 traction.
 Additionally, the assumption of continuity is no longer valid as new faces
 are formed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
c) Point of material seperation: again, the force applied by the traction
 encompasses a very small area, which may result in an unrealistically high
 magnitude of the traction.
 Additionally, the assumption of continuity is no longer valid as new faces
 are formed.

\begin_layout Subsection
Describe and sketch three physical situations in which the strain component
 at a point 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{xx}$
\end_inset

 is undefined.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Below are situations where strain components are undefined and (at least
 a partial) reason why (shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Examples-of-undefined"

\end_inset

):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
a) At a corner: 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta X$
\end_inset

 is undefined at the boundary of a body.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
b) At a crack front: the area 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta X$
\end_inset

 is discontinuous and therefore not differentiable.
 This results in a strong formulation of strain being undefined and thus
 requiring a weak formulation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
c) Point of material seperation: again, strains are discontinuous and the
 area 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta X$
\end_inset

 is vanishingly small, which result in strain being undefined.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Determine the maximum permitted load for the beam shown in Fig.
 1.2 when the maximum shear stress is 15,000 psi.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
a) Work for this problem is shown on the following pages.
 Calculated solution for the maximum value of P was 90,000 lb.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
b) Results were calculated using Abaqus.
 Results (in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

) show the maximum allowable shear stress 
\begin_inset Formula $(J_{2})$
\end_inset

 was obtained when the applied load 
\begin_inset Formula $P=7,250$

 psi.
 Maximum stress was observed at the edges near the two reaction forces on
 the lower boundary of the beam with the following material parameters:

\begin_layout Itemize
c) The problem statement defines the load and reaction to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

concentrated
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 A concentrated force implies the force will be applied over a negligible
 area.
 Because of this, the magnitude of the resulting traction will be infinite
 (undefined) for any nonzero force vector.
 Therefore, the permitted load 
\begin_inset Formula $(P)\mbox{ }$
\end_inset

 in this situation is zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
What is the load at which the glass plate with a hole in it will break?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A solution was obtained from literature where the stress concentration factor
 
\begin_inset Formula $(K)$
\end_inset

 at the boundary of the whole was defined as:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
K=3.000-3.140(d/D)+3.667(d/D)^{2}-1.527(d/D)^{3}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 is the thickness of the plate and 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 is the height of the plate.
 This definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 yielded a value of 
\begin_inset Formula $2.875$
\end_inset

 for this problem.
 Therefore, the load at which the glass plate will break was calculated
 as:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P_{max}=\sigma_{ult}A/K=10,000*(6*0.25)/2.875=5.217\text{ kip}
\]

\end_inset

 in the plate?
