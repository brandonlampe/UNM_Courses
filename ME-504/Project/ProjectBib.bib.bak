  Abstract                 = {ABSTRACT: Recent investments in the Sandia SIERRA Mechanics code suite have supplied the basic building blocks for realizing a multi-physics capability for repository systems engineering. These pieces are being assembled under an existing Laboratory Directed Research and Development effort to demonstrate an adaptive multi-physics framework for addressing the disparate time and length scales associated with geomechanics problems such as waste storage and resource extraction. As a demonstration of the features of this developing technology, a three-dimensional coupled thermal-mechanical analysis of a generic salt repository for high-level waste was performed. Two different analysis domains and mesh discretizations were utilized; one for the thermal analysis and a different discretization for the geomechanics analysis. Field transfer operators in the SIERRA toolkit were used to pass interpolated nodal temperature and displacement data between the different domains. Some of the discriminating features of this highly nonlinear, thermal-mechanical analysis include the use of large strain, large deformation mechanics, the use of both thermal and mechanical contact surfaces and the use of continuously updated radiation view factor calculations for the deforming storage rooms. The results of the analyses will be used to contrast the repository response solutions obtained for both a multi-mechanism deformation model (MD) and a power law creep (PLC) model representation of the salt behavior. 1. INTRODUCTION The development of the SIERRA Mechanics [1] code suite has been funded by the Department of Energy (DOE) Advanced Simulation and Computing (ASC) program for over ten years. The goal is the development of massively parallel multi-physics capabilities to support the Sandia engineering sciences mission. SIERRA Mechanics was designed and developed to run on the latest and most sophisticated massively parallel computing hardware; spanning the hardware compute space from a single workstation to compute systems with 1000's of processors. The foundation of SIERRA Mechanics is the SIERRA toolkit which provides finite element application code services such as: (1) mesh and field data management, both parallel and distributed, (2) transfer operators for mapping field variables from one mechanics application to another, (3) a solution controller for code coupling, and (4) included third party libraries (e.g. solver libraries, MPI communications package, etc.). The SIERRA Mechanics code suite is comprised of application codes that address specific physics regimes. The two SIERRA Mechanics codes which are used in thermal-mechanical coupling are Aria [2] and Adagio [3]. The suite of physics currently supported by Aria includes the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, energy transport equation, species transport equations, as well as generalized scalar, vector and tensor transport equations. A multiphase porous flow capability is a recent addition to Aria. Aria also has some basic geochemistry functionality available through embedded chemistry packages. Adagio has some discriminating technology that has been developed at Sandia involving the use of matrix-free iterative solution algorithms that allow extremely large and highly nonlinear problems to be solved efficiently. This technology also lends itself to effective and scalable implementation on massively parallel (MP) computers. The actual thermal-mechanical coupling is done through a flexible solution controller within SIERRA Mechanics called Arpeggio.},
