Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Granular (or crushed) salt is a candidate material for sealing the Waste
 Isolation Pilot Plant's (WIPP) shafts, drifts, and boreholes; therefore,
 the ability of crushed salt to prevent fluid migration is of interest.
 The objective of our research is to better understand the mechanical properties
 of crushed salt as they pertain to its transport properties, most notably
 its intrinsic permeability, which will provide a direct measure of its
 adequacy as a sealing material.
 Because a materials permeability is directly related to the pore volume
 of the material (along with connectivity of the pores), we are currently
 focusing on the ability of a constitutive model to accurately predict volumetri
c strain.
 In a effort to complete this objective, we have performed a suite of laboratory
 tests on crushed salt over a variety of conditions and have measured it's
 transient deformation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following sections will first familiarize the reader with existing constitut
ive models.
 Then a description of typical test methods and results are presented.
 A brief description of the currently employed constitutive models is provided
 followed by the model description and results.
 We will compare the results of different constitutive models to our measured
 data and quantify the ability of these models to predict the measured strain
 values.

Literature Review
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mechanical properties of in situ salt were first well characterized by Munson
 and Dawson during the early 1970's
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, where they first utilized an Arrhenius type equation to describe the time
 dependent deformation of salt, which is now common practice, this relationship
 is shown below: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\dot{\epsilon}=C_{1}*exp\Bigg(\frac{-Q_{a}}{RT}\Bigg)
\]

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During that same period, crushed salt became of interest to the engineering
 community also, predominately for use as a seal material around nuclear
 wast packages, shafts, and other openings associated with the storage of
 nuclear waste.
 The first recorded laboratory tests, performed for obtaining constitutive
 parameters were uniaxial compression tests completed in 1978 on samples
 that were 5 centimeters in diameter 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Hansen1976"

\end_inset

.
 However, the small specimen sizes utilized in these early tests had nonuniform
 stress fields (from side and end friction) producing inconsistent results.
 Since the first tests on crushed salt were performed, testing techniques
 have advanced greatly and we are now able to accurately measures strains
 at at high temperatures and pressures that are representative of downhole
 conditions in a nuclear waste storage facility

During the last 39 years, over ten constitutive models have been developed
 for crushed salt, each based on varying degrees of phenomenology, micro
 mechanics, and/or empiricism
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Callahan1995"

\end_inset

.
 During the mid-1990's, the Crushed Salt (CS) model was developed, with
 funding from the US Dept.
 of Energy, which was the first model to combine several dominant deformation
 attributes of crushed salt, such as grain boundary pressure solutioning
 and dislocation creep, which are believed to be dominant deformation mechanisms
 of crushed salt 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Spiers1993,Zeuch1990,Callahan1998IJRM"

\end_inset

.
 Including these different deformation mechanisms is critical to accurately
 predicting the deformation of salt, as the dominant mechanism varies with
 local conditions

 The CS model has the ability to predict the deformation of crushed salt
 reasonably well at low temperatures, but at high temperatures Broome et
 al.

 showed the model predictions did not well represent the true deformations.
 An additional shortcoming of the CS model is the large number of material
 parameters (constants) associated with it, 31 independent parameters in
 total, which produce a highly nonlinear result that makes fitting parameters
 to a specific salt deposit very difficult.
 The US Dept.
 of Energy currently utilizes the CS model to aid in there planning and
 development of storage facilities; therefore this model is of particular
 interest to us.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More recently, Olivella and Gens 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Olivella2002"

\end_inset

 developed an additional constitutive model that utilizes a nonlinear viscous
 approach that again focused on capturing the deformation associated with
 the active deformation mechanisms at different conditions.
 This model is currently employed by the THERESA project, which is a European
 based group aimed at developing, verifying and improving the modeling capabilit
ies associated with the storage of nuclear waste.
 We do not currently have access to this model; therefore, this model will
 not be analyzed at this time.

Test Methods and Results

\begin_layout Standard
The laboratory data was obtained during a hydrostatic and shear compression
 tests of a crushed salt, approximate specimen geometry is shown in Figure

\end_inset

.
 Axial displacements were measured via linear variable differential transformers
 (LVDTs) placed external to the specimen, lateral displacements were measured
 with a pair of Shuler gages placed circumferentially around the specimen,
 and metering of the confining fluid volume.
 Results from the measured strains are shown in Figure

\begin_layout Section
Constitutive Models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We plan to predict the deformation measured during laboratory tests using
 the following constitutive models:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Generalized Hooke's law for linear elasticity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Drucker-Prager/cap plasticity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
CS Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first two constitutive models may be implemented using Abaqus once the
 material parameters are obtained from tests data.
 However, Abaqus does not contain the CS model in its library, but we wish
 to compare results of the CS model to other existing models.
 Therefore, we have programmed the CS model in the R language, and our algorithm
 produces the predicted strains from the CS model.
 This implementation of the CS model allows for the comparisons with other
 constitutive models in the Abaqus library when a single element is utilized.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Model Description
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Numerical analyses were performed using the program Abaqus/CAE 6.14-1 to
 perform the finite element analyses.
 Abaqus contains a range of constitutive models and elements to choose from.
 Currently, our finite element model contains 1,566 nodes and 1170 8-node
 brick elements.
 We plan on complete multiple meshes of our model with both less and more
 elements to determine how many elements are needed for convergence of a
 solution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our model geometry consists of two end platens modeled as linear elastic
 aluminum and the test specimen, which is (*will be) be modeled as both
 an elastic and viscoplastic material.
 The test specimen was assumed to contain two orthogonal planes of symmetry,
 each with essential boundary conditions (zero displacement).
 The upper platen was also defined with an essential boundary condition
 of zero displacement.
 The lower platen and the curved face of the specimen were both defined
 as having natural boundary conditions (prescribed force).
 The boundary condition on the curved face of the specimen were defined
 as a constant pressure (no shear component) that represents the confining
 fluid.
 Additionally, the lower platen was prescribed an constant pressure.
 Magnitudes of the prescribed natural boundary conditions varied depending
 on the simulated test scenario (e.g., were equal for hydrostatic compression
 test and not equal shear compression test).
 Interactions between the salt specimen and the end platens were also modeled
 in attempt to capture the influence of end affects.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Numerical Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Very limited results have been obtained thus far, below Figures 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 show the deformed mesh with contour plots of the numerical results.
 These results were obtained from modeling a linear elastic specimen under
 a hydrostatic stress of 200 pounds per square inch (psi).
 These initial results verified that essential boundary conditions are acting
 as intended, i.e.
 zero displacement at the upper platen and across the planes of symmetry.
 Natural boundary conditions also appear to be correctly implemented as
 the material as uniformly deformed in and up as was expected from a linear
 elastic model.
 Frictional affects between the platens and specimen also appear to be captured,
 as the stress distribution is not radially uniform at the specimen ends,
 which was expected.
