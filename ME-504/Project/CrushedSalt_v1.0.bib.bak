I strongly recommend to first start the command prompt, then navigate to the directory where you save the program and start it by typing its name on the command line (after typing the first two or three letters, you can usually use the tabulator key to let Windows auto-complete the name rather than typing the whole long name; if there are several programs and/or files that start with the same letters, repeatedly pressing the tabulator key lets your browse through the list). If you start the program by just double-clicking in Windows Explorer, it will terminate by closing its window, which you may want to avoid since you will not be able to read important information, e.g., error notifications etc. that may appear just before termination.
These are not commercial programs and are distributed "as is" without any guarantee that they compute the correct results for your problem. I appreciate a short notice by email if you detect errors, however, correcting them will be done on an irregular basis.

  Abstract                 = {DEDICATION: Over the years, Professor Charles Fairhurst has consistently emphasized the need for guidance in rock mechanics from general principles of mechanics while advocating the development of a balanced insight obtained through intelligent laboratory and field experimentation. Through his influence, the rock mechanics field has progressed steadily over the past three decades and can boast a cooperation between field engineers and research colleagues. These ideals, along with his pioneering spirit, have prompted us to dedicate this paper to Charles. ABSTRACT: An ever-present key question for rock mechanics analysts is: "How can one-dimensional laboratory equations be generalized such that they are valid for arbitrary, three-dimensional stress states?" Classical thermodynamics principles are used in this paper to derive a proper three-dimensional generalization consistent with laboratory stress and strain measures. The multiaxial form of the equation permits the natural separation of shear and volumetric material behavior without the assumption of a unique flow potential. Results of an underground room simulation show the importance of different generalizations which emphasizes the need for testing where the principal stresses are unique.1 INTRODUCTIONLaboratory tests on rocks and soils typically involve stress states in which two of the principal Stresses are equal, such as uniaxial compression, triaxial compression, and triaxial extension. One-dimensional (scalar) constitutive laws based on these tests provide no information about how materials deform when subjected to general stress states in which all three principal stresses are unique. Understanding such behavior is important since for underground openings, most of the surrounding material is stressed in states other than pure triaxial compression or pure triaxial extension. Different assumptions about generalizing one-dimensional laboratory laws for use with three-dimensional stress states can lead to calculated deformations that differ significantly. Clearly, a proper generalization must be made for design calculations that guide the development of underground structures.2 THERMODYNAMIC CONCEPTSWe consider a macroscopic sample of material that is subjected to boundary loads causing inelastic, homogeneous deformation. The deformation is measured by tensorial strains eijand the boundary loading by tractions ti = njsij, the inner product of the normal to the boundary and the tensorial stress. For small changes in deformation, the boundary loads perform work according to (available in full paper)},

  Abstract                 = {ABSTRACT:This paper presents laboratory results obtained for determining the minimum gas pressures of compressed natural gas (CNG) caverns in salt. The laboratory test results comprise constant stress creep tests and quasi-static strength tests on cylindrical specimens of salt having a diameter of 10 cm and a length of 20 cm. These types of tests impose confining pressure acting on the circumference of the specimen and compressive axial stress acting on the specimen faces. The tests at a Lode angle of +30o are termed triaxial compression because the specimen shortens and the tests at a Lode angle of ?30o are termed triaxial extension because the specimen length increases. This paper uses the test data to evaluate how changes in Lode angle can affect the deformational behavior of salt. Typically, the creep rate and strength potential boundaries for salt are considered independent of Lode angle, but this suite of tests illustrates how such assumptions may be invalid. The creep tests investigate how changes in Lode angle may affect salt response during primary and secondary creep. The quasi-static strength tests illustrate the lower strength of salt at triaxial extension states of stress compared to triaxial compression.INTRODUCTIONThe structural stability of underground openings in salt depends on the strength and deformation characteristics of the salt surrounding and overlying the opening. Even with complete knowledge of the usual salt properties, problems may still arise because the state-of-the-art in salt mechanics has not advanced to the point of a full understanding of salt response at all possible states of stress and load histories.The prevailing engineering application view of natural rock salt generally considers salt to be an isotropic material whose behavior is independent of the orientation of the applied principal stresses. [Note that regardless of the state of stress (so long as the stress tensor is symmetric) the state of stress is completely specified by the value of the three principal components.] For this paper, isotropy is assumed and the state of stress is represented by the three invariants, I1 (representing mean stress), J2 (representing shear stress), and {\o} (a convenient alternative to J3 , also known as Lode angle).The Lode angle describes the magnitude of the intermediate principal stress with respect to the maximum and minimum principal stress values. For given values of I1 and J2, the Lode angle changes from +30$\,^{\circ}$ to ?30$\,^{\circ}$ as the intermediate principal stress value changes from being equal to the maximum principal to being equal to the minimum principal stress. Many models assume that the material behavior depends only on I1 and J2. The results presented in this paper show that the Lode angle should not be disregarded because there appears to be an observable difference in the strength and creep behavior of salt as the Lode angle changes.},

  Abstract                 = {Eight hydrostatic compression creep tests were performed on crushed salt specimens fabricated from Avery Island dome salt. Following the creep test, each specimen was tested in unconfined compression. The experiments were performed to assess the influence of the following four variables on the consolidation and unconfined strength of crushed salt: grain size distribution, temperature, time, and moisture content. The experiment design comprised a half-fraction factorial matrix at two levels. The levels of each variable investigated were grain size distribution, uniform-graded and well-graded (coefficient of uniformity of 1 and 8); temperature 25/sup 0/C and 100/sup 0/C; time, 3.5 x 10/sup 3/s and 950 x 10/sup 3/s (approximately 60 minutes and 11 days, respectively); and moisture content, dry and wet (85\% relative humidity for 24 hours). The hydrostatic creep stress was 10 MPa. The unconfined compression tests were performed at an axial strain rate of 1 x 10/sup -5/s/sup -1/. Results show that the variables time and moisture content have the greatest influence on creep consolidation, while grain size distribution and, to a somewhat lesser degree, temperature have the greatest influence on total consolidation. Time and moisture content and the confounded two-factor interactions between either grain size distribution and time or temperature and moisture content have the greatest influence on unconfined strength. 7 refs., 7 figs., 11 tabs.},

  Abstract                 = {ABSTRACT: Recent investments in the Sandia SIERRA Mechanics code suite have supplied the basic building blocks for realizing a multi-physics capability for repository systems engineering. These pieces are being assembled under an existing Laboratory Directed Research and Development effort to demonstrate an adaptive multi-physics framework for addressing the disparate time and length scales associated with geomechanics problems such as waste storage and resource extraction. As a demonstration of the features of this developing technology, a three-dimensional coupled thermal-mechanical analysis of a generic salt repository for high-level waste was performed. Two different analysis domains and mesh discretizations were utilized; one for the thermal analysis and a different discretization for the geomechanics analysis. Field transfer operators in the SIERRA toolkit were used to pass interpolated nodal temperature and displacement data between the different domains. Some of the discriminating features of this highly nonlinear, thermal-mechanical analysis include the use of large strain, large deformation mechanics, the use of both thermal and mechanical contact surfaces and the use of continuously updated radiation view factor calculations for the deforming storage rooms. The results of the analyses will be used to contrast the repository response solutions obtained for both a multi-mechanism deformation model (MD) and a power law creep (PLC) model representation of the salt behavior. 1. INTRODUCTION The development of the SIERRA Mechanics [1] code suite has been funded by the Department of Energy (DOE) Advanced Simulation and Computing (ASC) program for over ten years. The goal is the development of massively parallel multi-physics capabilities to support the Sandia engineering sciences mission. SIERRA Mechanics was designed and developed to run on the latest and most sophisticated massively parallel computing hardware; spanning the hardware compute space from a single workstation to compute systems with 1000's of processors. The foundation of SIERRA Mechanics is the SIERRA toolkit which provides finite element application code services such as: (1) mesh and field data management, both parallel and distributed, (2) transfer operators for mapping field variables from one mechanics application to another, (3) a solution controller for code coupling, and (4) included third party libraries (e.g. solver libraries, MPI communications package, etc.). The SIERRA Mechanics code suite is comprised of application codes that address specific physics regimes. The two SIERRA Mechanics codes which are used in thermal-mechanical coupling are Aria [2] and Adagio [3]. The suite of physics currently supported by Aria includes the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, energy transport equation, species transport equations, as well as generalized scalar, vector and tensor transport equations. A multiphase porous flow capability is a recent addition to Aria. Aria also has some basic geochemistry functionality available through embedded chemistry packages. Adagio has some discriminating technology that has been developed at Sandia involving the use of matrix-free iterative solution algorithms that allow extremely large and highly nonlinear problems to be solved efficiently. This technology also lends itself to effective and scalable implementation on massively parallel (MP) computers. The actual thermal-mechanical coupling is done through a flexible solution controller within SIERRA Mechanics called Arpeggio.},
