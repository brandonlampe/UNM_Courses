Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Granular (or crushed) salt is a candidate material for sealing the Waste
 Isolation Pilot Plant's (WIPP) shafts, drifts, and boreholes 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

; therefore, the ability of crushed salt to prevent fluid migration is of
 interest.
 The objective of our research is to better understand the mechanical properties
 of crushed salt as they pertain to its transport properties.
 Most notably, we are interested in its intrinsic permeability, which will
 provide a direct measure of its adequacy as a sealing material.
 During recent laboratory tests, a correlation has been observed between
 the volumetric strain and the intrinsic permeability of crushed salt, where
 20 percent volumetric strain has resulted in permeability decreasing by
 over nine orders of magnitude.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have performed a laboratory test on crushed salt where the time dependent
 volumetric strain was measured while under a constant stress (creep).
 The objective of this paper is to determine if Abaqus contains a constitutive
 model capable of predicting the deformation observed during this experiment.
 Additionally, a comparison is made between results obtained using a general
 constitutive equation in Abaqus and results from a constitutive equation
 designed specifically for the modeling of crushed salt deformation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following sections will first familiarize the reader with the current
 state of crushed-salt constitutive models.
 Then a description of the laboratory experiment performed on a crushed-salt
 specimen is given.
 A brief description of the constitutive models utilized to simulate the
 laboratory experiment are provided.
 Numerical results are then compared between constitutive models and our
 measured data in an attempt to determine if the selected models have the
 ability to capture characteristics shown in the laboratory experiment.

Literature Review
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mechanical properties of in situ salt were well characterized by Munson
 and Dawson during the early 1970's
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Munson1979"

\end_inset

, where they first utilized an Arrhenius type equation to describe the time
 dependent deformation of salt (Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Creep_01"

\end_inset

), which is now common practice.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\dot{e}_{11}=C_{1}*exp\Bigg(\frac{-Q_{a}t}{RT}\Bigg)\label{eq:Creep_01}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During that same period, crushed salt became of interest to the engineering
 community also, predominately for use as a seal material around nuclear
 waste packages, shafts, and other openings associated with the storage
 of nuclear waste.
 The first recorded laboratory tests, performed for obtaining constitutive
 parameters, were uniaxial compression tests completed in 1978 on samples
 that were 5 centimeters in diameter 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Hansen1976"

\end_inset

.
 However, the small specimen sizes utilized in these early tests resulted
 in nonuniform stress fields (from side and end friction) producing inconsistent
 results.
 Since the first tests on crushed salt were performed, testing techniques
 have advanced greatly and we are now able to accurately measures strains
 at at high temperatures and pressures that are representative of downhole
 conditions in a nuclear waste storage facility

During the last 39 years, over ten constitutive models have been developed
 for crushed salt, each based on varying degrees of phenomenology, micro
 mechanics, and/or empiricism
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Callahan1995"

\end_inset

.
 During the mid-1990's, the Crushed Salt (CS) Model was developed, which
 was the first model to combine several dominant deformation attributes
 of crushed salt.
 These attributes include grain boundary pressure solutioning and dislocation
 creep, which are believed to be dominant deformation mechanisms of crushed
 salt 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Spiers1993,Zeuch1990,Callahan1998IJRM"

\end_inset

.
 Including these different deformation mechanisms is believed to be critical
 to accurately predicting the deformation of salt

 The CS Model has the ability to predict the deformation of crushed salt
 reasonably well at low temperatures, but at high temperatures Broome et
 al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 showed the model predictions did not well represent the true deformations.
 An additional shortcoming of the CS Model is the large number of material
 parameters (constants) associated with it, 31 independent parameters in
 total, which produce a highly nonlinear result that makes fitting parameters
 to a specific salt deposit very difficult.
 The US Dept.
 of Energy currently utilizes the CS Model to aid in there planning and
 development of storage facilities; therefore this model is of particular
 interest to us.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More recently, Olivella and Gens 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Olivella2002"

\end_inset

 developed an additional constitutive model that utilizes a nonlinear viscous
 approach that again focused on capturing the deformation associated with
 the active deformation mechanisms at different conditions.
 This model is currently employed by the THERESA project, which is a European
 based group aimed at developing, verifying and improving the modeling capabilit
ies associated with the storage of nuclear waste.
 We do not currently have access to this model; therefore, this model will
 not be analyzed at this time.

\begin_layout Section
Test Method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Experimental data was obtained during a hydrostatic creep test of a crushed
 salt specimen, approximate specimen geometry of the speciment was 200 mm
 in heightand 100 mm in diameter (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Sample"

\end_inset

).
 The test was performed over a 24-hour period (86,400 seconds) at a mean
 pressure of 20 MPa.
 Axial force was applied via a hydraulic ram and lateral force was applied
 via a low viscosity fluid that surrounded the vertical sides of the specimen.
 Axial displacements were measured with linear variable differential transformer
s (LVDTs) placed external to the specimen.
 Lateral deformations were measured with a pair of Schuler gages placed
 circumferentially around the specimen, and volumetric strains were measured
 directly with a dilatometer that metered the confining fluid volume in
 the test chamber.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Post test analyses revealed that deformations were approximately isotropic.
 Although, nonuniform deformation occured near the ends of the specimen,
 where signs of end friction were observed.
 These signs included distinct cone shape regions near both ends of the
 specimen.

\begin_layout Section
Constitutive Models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Simulations of the time-dependent deformation during a creep tests were
 performed using the following constitutive models:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
linear isotropic viscoelasticity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
nonlinear isotropic viscoplasticity (CS Model)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above models were chosen because they both predict time dependent deformatio
n, which is an observed phenomena with crushed salt.
 The fundamental difference between two models are that one is elastic (no
 permanent deformation is predicted) and the other is plastic (allows for
 permanent deformation).
 Although a linear elastic constitutive model was not explicitly used, both
 of the above constitutive models assume that stress increments are the
 result of an elastic strain increment.
 Therefore, the following values were used in the formulation of the isotropic
 elasticity tensor:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Young's Modulus: 5,625 MPa
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Poisson's Ratio: -0.75
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The linear isotropic viscoelastic model was implemented in Abaqus 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Abaqus2012"

\end_inset

.
 However, Abaqus does not contain the CS Model in its constitutive library.
 Therefore, the constitutive equations for the CS Model were executed by
 a driver program written in the Python language.
 Abaqus utilized the finite element method (FEM) to solve the complete set
 of field equations associated with the model (speciemen and end platens),
 where the driver program merely solved the defined differential equations
 associated with the CS Model with the prescribed boundary conditions.
 Essentially, results from the driver program represent the solution for
 a single element discretization with boundary conditions applied directly
 to the specimen, whereas FEM allowed for boundary conditions to be applied
 upon adjacent materials where definitions of the interaction type were
 prescribed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The linear viscoelastic model in Abaqus is a very general model that may
 be suited for modeling many different types of materials undergoing time
 dependent deformation.
 This generality is made possible by the user defining material specific
 parameters.
 Whereas the CS Model was specifically developed for the modeling of crushed
 salt.
 Because of its purpose-built nature, the CS Model contains many parameters
 not accounted for in the linear isotropic viscoelastic model, such as water
 content, grain size, and fractional density.

\begin_layout Subsection
Linear Isotropic Viscoelasticity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The hereditary integral form for linear isotropic viscoelasticity under
 a prescribed stress was utilized by Abaqus (Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:abaqus_visco"

\end_inset

).
 Stress was defined in terms of a reduced (normalized) time (
\begin_inset Formula $\tau)$
\end_inset

 , which was related to the simulation time through Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:reduced_time"

\end_inset

.
 The relaxation function and creep functions, (
\begin_inset Formula $K(\tau)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $G(\tau)$
\end_inset

, respectively, were also defined in terms of a normalized time using a
 series of exponentials known as a Prony series (Equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:prony"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:prony_2"

\end_inset

).
 Prony series parameters were fit using a least squares algorithm to creep
 test data in Abaqus CAE.
 The implemented linear visc constitutive equation utilized four material
 parameters (Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:prony_parm"

\end_inset

).
 Because no shear data was made available for the Prony series calculations,
 the shear paramter 
\begin_inset Formula $G$

 was defined as zero for all values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{i}$

\begin_layout Subsection
CS Constitutive Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The CS Model contains mechanisms designed to capture the believed operative
 deformation mechanisms in crushed salt, namely dislocation creep and pressure
 solutioning.
 An assumptino of the CS Model is that dislocation creep and pressure solutionin
g deformations are additive and the magnitudes of each depend on the current
 state of the crushed salt.
 The general form of the CS model provides a formulation of the plastic
 strain rate tensor (
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\boldsymbol{e}^{c}}$
\end_inset

).
 Where the total predicted plastic strain is composed of both the inelastic
 strain rate measures for dislocation creep and pressure solution, 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\boldsymbol{e}_{eq}^{d}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\boldsymbol{e}_{eq}^{w}}$
\end_inset

, respectively.
 The magnitude of the respective strains are functions of an an equivalent
 stress (
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{eq}^{f}$
\end_inset

).
 Where The flow potential in the CS Model has been formulated in terms of
 an equivalent stress (
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{eq}$
\end_inset

), which provides for a more flexible non-associative type flow.

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 Physical data, such as fractional density (
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

), water content (
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

), and grain size (
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

) are utilized as direct input into the constitutive model.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 is a strain dependent variable, which is held at unity for small volumetric
 strain (
\begin_inset Formula $exp(e_{v}<15\%$
\end_inset

), which was the case for our simulations.
 The dislocation creep (
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\boldsymbol{e}_{eq}^{d}}$
\end_inset

) equations are not listed here and the 20 parameters in that model were
 held constant af values suggested by Munson et al.

Finite Element Modeling

\begin_layout Standard
The software package Abaqus/CAE 6.14-1 was utilized to perform finite element
 analyses using the linearly isotropic viscoelastic constitutive model.
 Multiple mesh discretizations of the salt specimen were created with a
 varying number of 8-node brick elements.
 Solutions for each of the discretizations were obtained and convergence
 of a solution was confirmed.
 Two planes of symmetry in the axial direction were utilized for the modeling,
 and because of this symmetry only a quarter of the model required discretizatio
n to obtain a solution to the three-dimensional problem (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Finite-element-discretization"

\end_inset

).
 Simulations were performed with an array of discretizations to ensure sufficien
t element density was used for convergence of the solution (Table

\begin_layout Standard
Our model geometry consisted of two end platens modeled as linear elastic
 aluminum (Young's and Poisson's moduli of 200 GPa and 0.3, respectively)
 and the test specimen, which was modeled as an linearly viscoelastic material.
 Both materials were assumed to be isotropic.
 Two orthogonal planes of symmetry were utilized for the model discretization,
 each having essential boundary conditions (zero displacement) applied normal
 to the plane of symmetry in radial directions (X and Y).
 The upper platen was also defined with an essential boundary condition
 of zero displacement in axial direction (Z).
 The lower platen and the curved face of the specimen were both defined
 as having essential boundary conditions (prescribed force).
 The boundary condition on the curved face of the specimen was defined as
 a constant pressure, which represents the normal stresses resulting from
 the confining fluid.
 Additionally, the lower platen was prescribed a constant normal pressure
 of 20 MPa in the Z direction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Physical observations of the specimen indicated that sufficient end friction
 existed as to influence the deformation of the specimen (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:BeforeAndAfter"

\end_inset

).
 Therefore, interactions between the salt specimen and the end platens were
 also modeled in attempt to capture the influence of these affects.

Numerical Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As part of the numerical analysis, a convergence study was completed to
 ensure that a sufficiently fine discretization had been employed.
 Data was obtained at a unique nodal point equidistant from the initial
 specimen ends along the Z axis, on the axis of symmetry.
 Very little deviation in results was shown across a large range of element
 sizes.
 The lack of deviation between mesh sizes ensures that a sufficiently refined
 mesh has been used.
 Additionally, if only average strains are desired, very few elements within
 the specimen are needed because of the modeled material and boundary conditions.
 That is, very few elements are needed because the problem is one of a hydrostat
ic stress being applied to an isotropic material.
 Results from this study are shown in Figure

Displacement occurred in both the axial and radial directions during the
 the test (Figures

).
 The influence of end friction was captured by the FE model, which is apparent
 by the additional stresses near the end of the specimen (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Shear-stresses-resulting"

\end_inset

) and the reduced deformation near the specimen ends ends (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Cross-section"

\end_inset

).
 When a more coarse mesh was utilized, the influence from the end platens
 was diminished.

Results from the CS Model and FE model both follow trends observed during
 the laboratory experiment (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:validation"

\end_inset

).
 Although, the CS Model over predicts the strain at early times, and the
 FE model under predicts these initial strains.
 The quality of both the CS Model and FE model to capture these specific
 test results are influenced greatly by the specific model parameters and
 how they were chosen.
 The CS Model parameters were fit to a large database that included both
 hydrostatic and shear tests, while the FE model was fit solely to the experimen
tal data described herein.

Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both constitutive models are capable of predicting volumetric strains similar
 to those measured during a creep test.
 The Abaqus model more closely represents the test data, but this is likely
 because Prony series values were fit exclusively to this loading path,
 whereas parameters of the CS Model were fit to a large range of loading
 paths.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Comparison of the predicted deformation at early times by the FE model to
 the experimental results that indicate that a model capable of predicting
 a higher level of early strains would be more suitable.
 This phenomena could likely be captured if a nonlinear viscoelastic model
 were utilized.
 Also, the over prediction of early strains by the CS Model may indicate
 that a nonlinear term could be removed from the model, or that the database
 used to fit material parameters consisted largely of shear tests that often
 result in higher rates of initial strain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To adequately validate the ability of the calculated Prony series utilized
 in the FE model, more loading paths must be simulated and compared to experimen
tal data.
 Based on the present analysis, the linear viscoelastic constitutive model
 in Abaqus is capable of predicting the observed volumetric deformation
 of crushed salt during a creep test, but the correlation between experimental
 and simulated results may improve with the implementation of a nonlinear
 model.
